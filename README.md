    npm install express-generator -g

(5) Enter the following command to generate the Express starter app. This will set the view to use Handlebars and will name the app express_Sequelize_RESTfulAPI_ParameterizedRoute_HelperFunction: 

    express --view=hbs express_Sequelize_RESTfulAPI_ParameterizedRoute_HelperFunction

(6) Once the process is complete, navigate into the express_Sequelize_RESTfulAPI_ParameterizedRoute_HelperFunction directory: 

    cd express_Sequelize_RESTfulAPI_ParameterizedRoute_HelperFunction
    
(7) Now in the express_Sequelize_RESTfulAPI_ParameterizedRoute_HelperFunction directory, run the following: 

    npm install

(8) Install Nodemon globally: 

    npm install -g nodemon
    
(9) Install Nodemon as a devDependency in the package.json file within the express_Sequelize_RESTfulAPI_ParameterizedRoute_HelperFunction directory:

    npm install -save-dev nodemon
    
(10) Install mysql2:

    npm install --save mysql2

(11) Install sequelize: 

    npm install --save sequelize@5.15.1

(12) Open in VS code:

    code . 


VS CODE

(13) Navigate to the routes/index.js file and require mysql2 and models in routes/index.js file.: ![Require mysql2 in routes-index js file (Sequelized_RESTfulAPI_ParameterizedRoute_HelperFunction)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35668707/70664512-87c80380-1c38-11ea-9f4c-578d1a9f807b.JPG)

COMMAND PROMPT

(14) Create necessary sequelize folders and files in project.:

(15)  Generate a model file for the actor table. (-h: IP/Hostname; -d: Database; -u: Username for database; -x: Password for database; -o: directory to place the models; -t: comma-seperated names of tables to import):  

    sequelize-auto -h localhost -d sakila -u root -x Password1! -o "./models" -t film,actor,film_actor
    
VS CODE

(16) Create a new folder in your "models" folder called rel. Create a file in your rel folder called associations.js and define the relationships between the "film" and "actor" models in this file.: ![In models folder create rel folder and an associations js file in the rel folder (Sequelized_RESTfulAPI_ParameterizedRoute_HelperFunction)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35668707/70664567-a62dff00-1c38-11ea-8366-d5729f01d16e.JPG)

(17) In the models/index.js file add associations constant and at the bottom of the models/index.js file add the call to associations function.: ![Call associations function in models-index js file (Sequelized_RESTfulAPI_ParameterizedRoute_HelperFunction)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35668707/70664653-d4abda00-1c38-11ea-964b-e600d6275abd.JPG)

(18) Open config/config.json file and change settings to connect to the database.: ![Update database connection info in config-config json file (Sequelized_RESTfulAPI_ParameterizedRoute_HelperFunction)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35668707/70664720-f2793f00-1c38-11ea-9389-3e3a3a1789d5.JPG)

(19) Open app.js file at the root of the project and include the './model" folder so that the models are available everywhere in the application.: ![Require models in app js file (Sequelized_RESTfulAPI_ParameterizedRoute_HelperFunction)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35668707/70664768-13419480-1c39-11ea-94aa-914467936126.JPG)

(20) Add sequelize sync code above module.exports in the app.js file to ensure that the tables within the models in the project are the same as in the database.: ![Add models sequelize sync in app js file (Sequelized_RESTfulAPI_ParameterizedRoute_HelperFunction)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35668707/70664826-379d7100-1c39-11ea-8a2c-39f5b8583f00.JPG)

(21) In the routes/index.js file require the models.: ![Require models in index js file (Sequelized_RESTfulAPI_ParameterizedRoute_HelperFunction)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35668707/70664894-57cd3000-1c39-11ea-92d5-01ed54e3cfa7.JPG)

(22) In the routes/index.js file add get() route for /actors that will use the findAll() method.: ![Add get() route for actors id in index js file (Sequelized_RESTfulAPI_ParameterizedRoute_HelperFunction)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35668707/70664947-77fcef00-1c39-11ea-867d-d7a9bbac1b4e.JPG)

(23) Run nodemon in terminal to see DB sync'd up: 

    nodemon

POSTMAN

(24) Navigate to localhost3000/actors/[insert specific id #] in Postman and perform a GET request to view data.: ![Perform a GET request for localhost3000 - actors in POSTMAN to view data (Sequelize_RESTfulAPI_ParameterizedRoute_HelperFunction)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35668707/70665007-94992700-1c39-11ea-9ea1-6a7215b09346.JPG)
